~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This helper module automates playback on Spotify's web player using
Playwright.  It is used by the MCP chatbot to play a requested song when
the user instructs the assistant to "play <song> on Spotify".  It logs
into Spotify with credentials provided via environment variables or
configuration, searches for the song, clicks the first result, and
ensures playback starts.

The automation launches Chromium with the autoplay policy disabled to
ensure media playback does not require a user gesture.  It runs a new
browser instance for each call and closes it when done.

You must install Playwright and its Chromium runtime:

    pip install playwright
    playwright install chromium

In addition, set SPOTIFY_EMAIL and SPOTIFY_PASSWORD in your .env file or
export them in your environment.  If credentials are not provided the
function returns False.
